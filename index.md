The AI Security Verification Standard (AISVS) focuses on providing developers, architects, and security professionals with a structured checklist to verify the security and ethical considerations of AI-driven applications. Modeled after existing OWASP standards (such as the ASVS for web applications), AISVS will define categories of requirements for areas including:

1. [Training Data Governance & Bias Management](https://github.com/OWASP/AISVS/blob/main/1.0/en/0x10-C1-Training-Data-Governance.md.)
2. [User Input Validation](https://github.com/OWASP/AISVS/blob/main/1.0/en/0x10-C02-User-Input-Validation.md)
3. [Model Lifecycle Management & Change Control](https://github.com/OWASP/AISVS/blob/main/1.0/en/0x10-C03-Model-Lifecycle-Management.md)
4. [Infrastructure, Configuration & Deployment Security](https://github.com/OWASP/AISVS/blob/main/1.0/en/0x10-C04-Infrastructure.md)
5. [Access Control & Identity](https://github.com/OWASP/AISVS/blob/main/1.0/en/0x10-C05-Access-Control-and-Identity.md)
6. [Supply Chain Security for Models, Frameworks & Data](https://github.com/OWASP/AISVS/blob/main/1.0/en/0x10-C06-Supply-Chain.md)
7. [Model Behavior, Output Control & Safety Assurance](https://github.com/OWASP/AISVS/blob/main/1.0/en/0x10-C07-Model-Behavior.md)
8. [Memory, Embeddings & Vector Database Security](https://github.com/OWASP/AISVS/blob/main/1.0/en/0x10-C08-Memory-Embeddings-and-Vector-Database.md)
9. [Autonomous Orchestration & Agentic Action Security](https://github.com/OWASP/AISVS/blob/main/1.0/en/0x10-C09-Orchestration-and-Agentic-Action.md)
10. [Adversarial Robustness & Attack Resistance](https://github.com/OWASP/AISVS/blob/main/1.0/en/0x10-C10-Adversarial-Robustness.md)
11. [Privacy Protection & Personal Data Management](https://github.com/OWASP/AISVS/blob/main/1.0/en/0x10-C11-Privacy.md)
12. [Monitoring, Logging & Anomaly Detection](https://github.com/OWASP/AISVS/blob/main/1.0/en/0x10-C12-Monitoring-and-Logging.md)
13. [Human Oversight and Trust](https://github.com/OWASP/AISVS/blob/main/1.0/en/0x10-C13-Human-Oversight.md)

### Road Map
Phase 1 – Research and Category List Creation (Complete)

* Work on the category list is complete: [https://github.com/OWASP/AISVS/blob/main/1.0/en/Categories.md](https://github.com/OWASP/AISVS/blob/main/1.0/en/Categories.md)

Phase 2 – Requirement Creation 9 (Current Phase)

* Create a list of requirements for each category
* Refine the standard based on community, partner, and subject matter expert input.

Phase 3 – Beta Release and Pilot Testing

* Release a “beta” version of AISVS (v.1).
* Invite early adopters to test AISVS on real-world AI applications and gather feedback on usability and coverage.

Phase 4 – Final 1.0 Release

* Incorporate feedback from pilot testing.
* Formally publish Version 1.0 of AISVS, including comprehensive documentation and a lightweight checklist.

Phase 5 – Continuous Improvement

* Maintain the AISVS as an open-source project, encouraging community contributions.
* Periodically release updated versions reflecting emerging threats, novel AI approaches, and regulatory changes.
