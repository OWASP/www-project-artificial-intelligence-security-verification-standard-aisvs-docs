The AI Security Verification Standard (AISVS) focuses on providing developers, architects, and security professionals with a structured framework to evaluate and verify the security and ethical considerations of AI-driven applications. Modeled after existing OWASP standards (such as the ASVS for web applications), AISVS will define categories of requirements for areas including:

Data Integrity and Privacy: Ensuring the integrity of training data, verifying minimal and privacy-respecting data collection, and monitoring for data poisoning or bias.

Model Security: Guidance on tampering resistance, distribution of models, and policy enforcement.

Model Explainability and Transparency: Requirements that encourage interpretability and accountability.

Infrastructure and Deployment Security: Verification of containerization, cloud security, and code dependencies.

Ethical and Compliance Considerations: Requirements for fairness, bias mitigation, and regulatory compliance where applicable.

### Road Map
Phase 1 – Research and Drafting

* Collect relevant industry standards and research papers (e.g., NIST AI standards, ISO/IEC guidelines, privacy regulations).
* Create an initial draft of requirements that cover key areas: data security, model security, infrastructure, and ethical considerations.

Phase 2 – Community Review and Feedback

* Publish the draft in a public repository for the community to review.
* Host virtual roundtable discussions or workshops to gather industry feedback.
* Refine the standard based on community, partner, and subject matter expert input.

Phase 3 – Beta Release and Pilot Testing

* Release a “beta” version of AISVS.
* Invite early adopters to test AISVS on real-world AI applications and gather feedback on usability and coverage.

Phase 4 – Final Release

* Incorporate feedback from pilot testing.
* Formally publish Version 1.0 of AISVS, including comprehensive documentation and a lightweight checklist.

Phase 5 – Continuous Improvement

* Maintain the AISVS as an open-source project, encouraging community contributions.
* Periodically release updated versions reflecting emerging threats, novel AI approaches, and regulatory changes.
